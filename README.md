# My-Blogs-API-Project
**Created my own BLOGS API**
**_(Also used while integrating it properly with Frontend and Backend code files)_**

What is RESTFul API ?? <br/>
RESTful API is a type of web architecture that allows systems to communicate over the internet. It follows principles like statelessness, resource-based URLs, CRUD operations, and uses standard HTTP methods for actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. The data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML. RESTful APIs are widely used for building scalable and interoperable web services.

My BLOG RESTFul API features : 
1. GET all the blog posts
2. GET a specific post using its ID
3. POST a new post in My Blogs
4. PATCH an existing post if you want to edit
5. DELETE a specific post using its ID

Also to use my own API, I created a Frontend file "index.ejs" & Backend file "Backend_server.js"
Frontend : Interface to use all CRUD operations using API handled by Backend

In Backend (To Access and Use my own Blog API), I used AXIOS for introducing actions to all the functionalities I integrated in my Frontend Code. <br/>
Now What is Axios ?? <br/>
Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests in web applications. It works both in the browser and on the server using Node.js. Axios simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to interact with web servers or APIs.
